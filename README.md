# Zeitplan
Zeitplan is an application to help organize the academic life of students of all ages in order to have everything under control.  
This app was my first project on Android Development, develop in a span of two years (2020-2022).

## Main features
- Create your subjects quickly and easily, where you can assign colors to each of your subjects. When creating the subjects you will be able to see a variety of information, such as the grade at the moment, the name of your teacher and the days that you take that subject.
- With the subjects created you will be able to write down your tasks, exams and reminders of each of them easily and quickly, and manage them in a simple way.
- You can also create your class schedule, where you will see in a simple way when each of your classes starts or ends, or in which room they will take place.
- Manage your grades and see your progress in each subject as well as set goals for each of your subjects.
